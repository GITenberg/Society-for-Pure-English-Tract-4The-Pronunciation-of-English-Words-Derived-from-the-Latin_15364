    <h2>ON THE PRONUNCIATION OF ENGLISH WORDS DERIVED FROM
    LATIN</h2>

    <p>[This paper may perhaps need a few words of introduction
    concerning the history of the pronunciation of Latin in
    England.</p>

    <p>The Latin taught by Pope Gregory's missionaries to their
    English converts at the beginning of the seventh century was a
    living language. Its pronunciation, in the mouths of educated
    people when they spoke carefully, was still practically what it
    had been in the first century, with the following important
    exceptions. 1. The consonantal <i>u</i> was sounded like the
    <i>v</i> of modern English, 2. The <i>c</i> before front vowels
    (<i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>æ</i>, <i>&oelig;</i>), and
    the combinations <i>t&#301;</i>, <i>c&#301;</i> before vowels,
    were pronounced <i>ts</i>. 3. The <i>g</i> before front vowels
    had a sound closely resembling that of the Latin consonantal
    <i>i</i>. 4. The <i>s</i> between vowels was pronounced like
    our <i>s</i>. 5. The combinations <i>æ</i>, <i>&oelig;</i> were
    no longer pronounced as diphthongs, but like the simple
    <i>e</i>. 6. The ancient vowel-quantities were preserved only
    in the penultima of polysyllables (where they determined the
    stress); in all other positions the original system of
    quantities had given place to a new system based mainly on
    rhythm. Of this system in detail we have little certain
    knowledge; but one of its features was that the vowel which
    ended the first syllable of a disyllabic was always long:
    <i>p&#257;ter</i>, <i>p&#257;trem</i>, <i>D&#275;us</i>,
    <i>p&#299;us</i>, <i>&#299;ter</i>, <i>&#333;vis</i>,
    <i>h&#363;mus</i>.</p>

    <p>Even so early as the beginning of the fifth century, St.
    Augustine tells us that the vowel-quantities, which it was
    necessary to learn in order to write verse correctly, were not
    observed in speech. The Latin-speaking schoolboy had to learn
    them in much the same fashion as did the English schoolboy of
    the nineteenth century.</p>

    <p>It is interesting to observe that, while the English
    scholars of the tenth century pronounced their Latin in the
    manner which their ancestors had learned from the continental
    missionaries, the tradition of the ancient vowel-quantities
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span> still survived (to some extent
       at least) among their British neighbours, whose knowledge of
       Latin was an inheritance from the days of Roman rule. On
       this point the following passage from the preface to
       Ælfric's Latin Grammar (written for English schoolboys about
       A.D. 1000) is instructive:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Miror ualde quare multi corripiunt sillabas in prosa
        quae in metro breues sunt, cum prosa absoluta sit a lege
        metri; sicut pronuntiant <i>pater</i> brittonice et
        <i>malus</i> et similia, quae in metro habentur breues.
        Mihi tamen uidetur melius inuocare Deum Patrem honorifice
        producta sillaba quam brittonice corripere, quia nec Deus
        arti grammaticae subiciendus est.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The British contagion of which Ælfric here complains had no
    permanent effect. For after the Norman Conquest English boys
    learned their Latin from teachers whose ordinary language was
    French. For a time, they were not usually taught to write or
    read English, but only French and Latin; so that the Englishmen
    who attempted to write their native language did so in a
    phonetic orthography on a French basis. The higher classes in
    England, all through the thirteenth century, had two native
    languages, English and French.</p>

    <p>In the grammar schools, the Latin lessons were given in
    French; it was not till the middle of the fourteenth century
    that a bold educational reformer, John Cornwall, could venture
    to make English the vehicle of instruction. In reading Latin,
    the rhythmically-determined vowel-quantities of post-classical
    times were used; and the Roman letters were pronounced, first
    as they were in French, and afterwards as in English, but in
    the fourteenth century this made little difference.</p>

    <p>In Chaucer's time, the other nations of Europe, no less than
    England, pronounced Latin after the fashion of their own
    vernaculars. When, subsequently, the phonetic values of the
    letters in the vernacular gradually changed, the Latin
    pronunciation altered likewise. Hence, in the end, the
    pronunciation of Latin has become different in different
    countries. A scholar born in Italy has great difficulty in
    following a Frenchman speaking Latin. He has greater difficulty
    in understanding an Englishman's Latin, because in English the
    changes in the sounds of the letters have been greater than in
    any other language. Every vowel-letter has several sounds, and
    the normal long sound of every
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span> vowel-letter has no resemblance
       whatever to its normal short sound. As in England the
       pronunciation of Latin developed insensibly along with that
       of the native tongue, it eventually became so peculiar that
       by comparison the 'continental pronunciation' may be
       regarded as uniform.</p>

    <p>It is sometimes imagined that the modern English way of
    pronouncing Latin was a deliberate invention of the Protestant
    reformers. For this view there is no foundation in fact. It may
    be conceded that English ecclesiastics and scholars who had
    frequent occasion to converse in Latin with Italians would
    learn to pronounce it in the Italian way; and no doubt the
    Reformation must have operated to arrest the growing tendency
    to the Italianization of English Latin. But there is no
    evidence that before the Reformation the un-English
    pronunciation was taught in the schools. The grammar-school
    pronunciation of the early nineteenth century was the lineal
    descendant of the grammar-school pronunciation of the
    fourteenth century.</p>

    <p>This traditional system of pronunciation is now rapidly
    becoming obsolete, and for very good reasons. But it is the
    basis of the pronunciation of the many classical derivatives in
    English; and therefore it is highly important that we should
    understand precisely what it was before it began to be
    sophisticated (as in our own early days) by sporadic and
    inconsistent attempts to restore the classical quantities. In
    the following paper Mr. Sargeaunt describes, with a minuteness
    not before attempted, the genuine English tradition of Latin
    pronunciation, and points out its significance as a factor in
    the development of modern English.</p>

    <p class="author">H.B.]</p>
    <hr />

    <p>It seems not to be generally known that there is a real
    principle in the English pronunciation of words borrowed from
    Latin and Greek, whether directly or through French. In this
    matter the very knowledge of classical Latin, of its stresses
    and its quantities, still more perhaps an acquaintance with
    Greek, is apt to mislead. Some speakers seem to think that
    their scholarship will be doubted unless they say 'doctrínal'
    and 'scriptúral' and 'cinéma'. The object of this paper is to
    show by setting forth the principles consciously or
    unconsciously followed by our ancestors that such
    pronunciations are as erroneous as in the case of the ordinary
    man they are unnatural and pedantic. An exception for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span> which there is a reason must of
       course be accepted, but an exception for which reason is
       unsound is on every ground to be deprecated. Among other
       motives for preserving the traditional pronunciation must be
       reckoned the claim of poetry. Mark Pattison notes how a
       passage of Pope which deals with the Barrier Treaty loses
       much of its effect because we no longer stress the second
       syllable of 'barrier'. Pope's word is gone beyond recovery,
       but others which are threatened by false theories may yet be
       preserved.</p>

    <p>The <i>New English Dictionary</i>, whose business it is to
    record facts, shows that in not a few common words there is at
    present much confusion and uncertainty concerning the right
    pronunciation. This applies mostly to the position of the
    stress or, as some prefer to call it, the accent, but in many
    cases it is true also of the quantity of the vowels. It is
    desirable to show that there is a principle in this matter,
    rules which have been naturally and unconsciously obeyed,
    because they harmonize with the genius of the English
    tongue.</p>

    <p>For nearly three centuries from the Reformation to the
    Victorian era there was in this country a uniform pronunciation
    of Latin. It had its own definite principles, involving in some
    cases a disregard of the classical quantities though not of the
    classical stress or accent. It survives in borrowed words such
    as <i>&#257;li&#259;s</i> and <i>st&#259;mina</i>, in
    naturalized legal phrases, such as <i>N&#299;s&#299; Prius</i>
    and <i>&#333;nus probandi</i>, and with some few changes in the
    Westminster Play. This pronunciation is now out of fashion,
    but, since its supersession does not justify a change in the
    pronunciation of words which have become part of our language,
    it will be well to begin with a formulation of its rules.</p>

    <p>The rule of Latin stress was observed as it obtained in the
    time of Quintilian. In the earliest Latin the usage had been
    other, the stress coming as early in the word as was possible.
    Down to the days of Terence and probably somewhat later the old
    rule still held good of quadrisyllables with the scansion of
    <i>m&#365;l&#301;&#277;r&#301;s</i> or
    <i>m&#365;l&#301;&#277;r&#275;s</i>, but in other words had
    given way to the later Quintilian rule, that all words with a
    long unit as penultimate had the stress on the vowel in that
    unit, while words of more than two syllables with a short
    penultimate had the stress on the antepenultimate. I say 'unit'
    because here, as in scansion, what counts is not the syllable,
    but the vowel plus all the consonants that come between it and
    the next vowel. Thus <i>inférnus</i>, where the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span> penultimate vowel is short, no
       less than <i>suprémus</i>, where it is long, has the stress
       on the penultima. In <i>volucris</i>, where the penultimate
       unit was short, as it was in prose and could be in verse,
       the stress was on the <i>o</i>, but when <i>ucr</i> made a
       long unit the stress comes on the <i>u</i>, though of course
       the vowel remains short. In polysyllables there was a
       secondary stress on the alternate vowels. Ignorance of this
       usage has made a present-day critic falsely accuse
       Shakespeare of a false quantity in the line</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Coríolánus in Coríoli.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It may be safely said that from the Reformation to the
    nineteenth century no Englishman pronounced the last word
    otherwise than I have written it. The author of the Pronouncing
    Dictionary attached to the 'Dictionary of Gardening'
    unfortunately instructs us to say <i>gládiolus</i> on the
    ground that the <i>i</i> is short. The ground alleged, though
    true, is irrelevant, and, although Terence would have
    pronounced it <i>gládiolus</i>, Quintilian, like Cicero, would
    have said <i>gladíolus</i>. Mr. Myles quotes Pliny for the
    word, but Pliny would no more have thought of saying
    <i>gládiolus</i> than we should now think of saying 'laboúr'
    except when we are reading Chaucer.</p>

    <p>We need not here discuss the dubious exceptions to this
    rule, such as words with an enclitic attached, e.g.
    <i>prim&#259;que</i> in which some authorities put the stress
    on the vowel which precedes the enclitic, or such clipt words
    as 'illuc', where the stress may at one time have fallen on the
    last vowel. In any case no English word is concerned.</p>

    <p>In very long words the due alternation of stressed and
    unstressed vowels was not easy to maintain. There was no
    difficulty in such a combination as <i>hónoríficábilí</i> or as
    <i>tudínitátibús</i>, but with the halves put together there
    would be a tendency to say <i>hónoríficabilitúdinitátibus</i>.
    Thus there ought not to be much difficulty in saying
    <i>Cónstantínopólitáni</i>, whether you keep the long
    antepenultima or shorten it after the English way; but he who
    forced the reluctant word to end an hexameter must have had
    'Constantinóple' in his mind, and therefore said
    <i>Constántinópolitáni</i> with two false stresses. The result
    was an illicit lengthening of the second <i>o</i>. His other
    false quantity, the shortening of the second <i>i</i>, was due
    to the English pronunciation, the influence of such words as
    'metropol&#301;tan', and, as old schoolmasters used to put it,
    a neglect of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
       id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span> Gradus. Even when the stress
       falls on this antepenultimate <i>i</i>, it is short in
       English speech. Doubtless Milton shortened it in
       'Areopagitica', just as English usage made him lengthen the
       initial vowel of the word.</p>

    <p>Probably very few of the Englishmen who used the traditional
    pronunciation of Latin knew that they gave many different
    sounds to each of the symbols or letters. Words which have been
    transported bodily into English will provide examples under
    each head. It will be understood that in the traditional
    pronunciation of Latin these words were spoken exactly as they
    are spoken in the English of the present day. For the sake of
    simplicity it may be allowed us to ignore some distinctions
    rightly made by phoneticians. Thus the long initial vowel of
    <i>alias</i> is not really the same as the long initial vowel
    of <i>area</i>, but the two will be treated as identical. It
    will thus be possible to write of only three kinds of vowels,
    long, short, and obscure.</p>

    <p>The letter or symbol <i>a</i> stood for two long sounds,
    heard in the first syllables of <i>alias</i> and of
    <i>larva</i>, for the short sound heard in the first syllable
    of <i>stamina</i>, and for the obscure sound heard in the last
    syllable of each of these last two words in English.</p>

    <p>The letter <i>e</i> stood for the long sounds heard in
    <i>genus</i> and in <i>verbum</i>, for the short sound heard in
    <i>item</i>, and for the obscure sound heard in <i>cancer</i>.
    When it ended a word it had, if short, the sound of a short
    <i>i</i>, as in <i>pro lege</i>, <i>rege</i>, <i>grege</i>, as
    also in unstressed syllables in such words as <i>precentor</i>
    and <i>regalia</i>.</p>

    <p>The letter <i>i</i> stood for the two long sounds heard in
    <i>minor</i> and in <i>circus</i> and for the short sound heard
    in <i>premium</i> and <i>incubus</i>.</p>

    <p>The letter <i>o</i> stood for the two long sounds heard in
    <i>odium</i> and in <i>corpus</i>, for the short sound in
    <i>scrofula</i>, and for the obscure in <i>extempore</i>.</p>

    <p>The two long sounds of <i>u</i> are heard in <i>rumor</i>,
    if that spelling may be allowed, and in the middle syllable of
    <i>laburnum</i>, the two short sounds in the first <i>u</i> of
    <i>incubus</i> and in the first <i>u</i> of <i>lustrum</i>, the
    obscure sound in the final syllables of these two words.
    Further the long sound was preceded except after <i>l</i> and
    <i>r</i> by a parasitic <i>y</i> as in <i>albumen</i> and
    <i>incubus</i>. This parasitic <i>y</i> is perhaps not of very
    long standing. In some old families the tradition still compels
    such pronunciations as <i>moosic</i>.</p>

    <p>The diphthongs <i>æ</i> and <i>&oelig;</i> were merely
    <i>e</i>, while <i>au</i> and <i>eu</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"
       id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span> were sounded as in our
       <i>August</i> and <i>Euxine</i>. The two latter diphthongs
       stood alone in never being shortened even when they were
       unstressed and followed by two consonants. Thus men said
       <i>E&#862;ustolia</i> and <i>A&#862;ugustus</i>, while they
       said <i>Æ&#774;schylus</i> and <i>&OElig;&#774;dipus.</i>
       Dryden and many others usually wrote the <i>Æ</i> as
       <i>E</i>. Thus Garrick in a letter commends an adaptation of
       'Eschylus', and although Boswell reports him as asking
       Harris 'Pray, Sir, have you read Potter's <i>Æschylus</i>?'
       both the speaker and the reporter called the name
       <i>Eschylus</i>.</p>

    <p>The letter <i>y</i> was treated as <i>i</i>.</p>

    <p>The consonants were pronounced as in English words derived
    from Latin. Thus <i>c</i> before <i>e</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>y</i>,
    <i>æ</i>, and <i>&oelig;</i> was <i>s</i>, as in <i>census</i>,
    <i>circus</i>, <i>Cyrus</i>, <i>Cæsar</i>, and
    <i>c&oelig;lestial</i>, a spelling not classical and now out of
    use. Elsewhere <i>c</i> was <i>k</i>. Before the same vowels
    <i>g</i> was <i>j</i> (d&#658;), as in <i>genus</i>,
    <i>gibbus</i>, <i>gyrus</i>. The sibilant was voiced or
    voiceless as in English words, the one in <i>rosaceus</i>, the
    other in <i>saliva</i>.</p>

    <p>It will be seen that the Latin sounds were throughout
    frankly Anglicized. According to Burney a like principle was
    followed by Burke when he read French poetry aloud. He read it
    as though it were English. Thus on his lips the French word
    <i>comment</i> was pronounced as the English word
    <i>comment</i>.</p>

    <p>The rule that overrode all others, though it has the
    exceptions given below, was that vowels and any other
    diphthongs than <i>au</i> and <i>eu</i>, if they were followed
    by two consonants, were pronounced short. Thus <i>a</i> in
    <i>magnus</i>, though long in classical Latin, was pronounced
    as in our 'magnitude', and <i>e</i> in <i>census</i>, in Greek
    transcription represented by &eta;, was pronounced short, as it
    is when borrowed into English. So were the penultimate vowels
    in <i>villa</i>, <i>nullus</i>, <i>cæspes</i>.</p>

    <p>This rule of shortening the vowel before two consonants held
    good even when in fact only one was pronounced, as in
    <i>nullus</i> and other words where a double consonant was
    written and in Italian pronounced.</p>

    <p>Moreover, the parasitic <i>y</i> was treated as a consonant,
    hence our 'v&#259;cuum'.</p>

    <p>In the penultima <i>qu</i> was treated as a single
    consonant, so that the vowel was pronounced long in
    <i>&#257;quam</i>, <i>&#275;quam</i>, <i>in&#299;quam</i>,
    <i>l&#333;quor</i>. So it was after <i>o</i>, hence our
    'coll&#333;quial'; but in earlier syllables than the penultima
    <i>qu</i> was treated as a double consonant, hence our
    'sub&#259;queous', 'equity',
    'iniquity'.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>

    <p><b>Exceptions.</b></p>

    <p>1. When the former of the two consonants was <i>r</i> and
    the latter another consonant than <i>r</i>, as in the series
    represented by <i>larva</i>, <i>verbum</i>, <i>circus</i>,
    <i>corpus</i>, <i>laburnum</i>, the vowels are a separate class
    of long vowels, though not really recognized as such. Of course
    our ancestors and the Gradus marked them long because in verse
    the vowel with the two consonants makes a long unit.</p>

    <p>2. A fully stressed vowel before a mute and <i>r</i>, or
    before <i>d</i> or <i>pl</i>, was pronounced long in the
    penultima. Latin examples are <i>labrum</i>, <i>Hebrum</i>,
    <i>librum</i>, <i>probrum</i>, <i>rubrum</i>, <i>acrem</i>,
    <i>cedrum</i>, <i>vafrum</i>, <i>agrum</i>, <i>pigrum</i>,
    <i>aprum</i>, <i>veprem</i>, <i>patrem</i>, <i>citrum</i>,
    <i>utrum</i>, <i>triplus</i>, <i>duplex</i>, <i>Cyclops</i>.
    Moreover, in other syllables than the penultima the vowel in
    the same combinations was pronounced long if the two following
    vowels had no consonant between them, as <i>patria</i>,
    <i>Hadria</i>, <i>acrius</i>. (Our 'triple' comes from
    <i>triplum</i> and is a duplicate of '<i>treble</i>'. Perhaps
    the short vowel is due to its passage through French. Our
    'citron' comes from <i>citronem</i>, in which <i>i</i> was
    short.)</p>

    <p>3. The preposition and adverb <i>post</i> was pronounced
    with a long vowel both by itself and in composition with verbs,
    but its adjectives did not follow suit. Hence we say in English
    'p&#333;stpone', but 'p&#335;sterior' and
    'p&#335;sthumous'.</p>

    <p>Monosyllables ending in a vowel were pronounced long, those
    ending in a consonant short. Enclitics like <i>que</i> were no
    real exception as they formed part of the preceding word. There
    were, however, some real exceptions.</p>

    <p>1. Pronouns ending in <i>-os</i>, as <i>hos</i>,
    <i>quos</i>. These followed <i>eos</i> and <i>illos</i>.</p>

    <p>2. Words ending in <i>-es</i>, as <i>pes</i>,
    <i>res</i>.</p>

    <p>3. Words ending in <i>r</i>, as <i>par</i>, <i>fer</i>,
    <i>vir</i>, <i>cor</i>, <i>fur</i>. These had that form of long
    vowel which we use in 'part', 'fertile', 'virtue', 'cordate',
    'furtive'.</p>

    <p>In, disyllables the former vowel or diphthong, if followed
    by a single consonant, or by a mute and <i>r</i>, or by
    <i>cl</i> or <i>pl</i>, was pronounced long, a usage which
    according to Mr. Henry Bradley dates in spoken Latin from the
    fourth century. Examples are <i>apex</i>, <i>tenet</i>,
    <i>item</i>, <i>focus</i>, <i>pupa</i>, <i>Psyche</i>,
    <i>Cæsar</i>, <i>f&oelig;tus</i>. I believe that at first the
    only exceptions were <i>tibi</i>, <i>sibi</i>, <i>ibi</i>,
    <i>quibus</i>, <i>tribus</i>. In later days the imperfect and
    future of <i>sum</i> became exceptions. Here perhaps the short
    vowel arose from the hideous and wholly erroneous habit,
    happily never universal though still in some vogue, of reciting
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span> <i>erám</i>, <i>erás</i>,
       <i>erát</i>. There are actually schoolbooks which treat the
       verse <i>ictus</i>, the beat of the chanter's foot, as a
       word stress and prescribe <i>terra tribús scopulís</i>. I
       can say of these books only <i>Pereant ipsi, mutescant
       scriptores</i>, and do not mind using a post-classical word
       in order to say it.</p>

    <p>In disyllables the former vowel or diphthong, if followed
    immediately by another vowel or diphthong, had the quality, and
    if emphatic also the quality, of a long vowel. The distinction
    was not recognized, and seems not to be generally acknowledged
    even now. We seem not to have borrowed many words which will
    illustrate this. We have however <i>fiat</i>, and <i>pius</i>
    was pronounced exactly as we pronounce 'pious', while for a
    diphthong we may quote Shelley,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Mid the mountains Euganean</p>

            <p>I stood listening to the paean.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>English derivatives will show the long quality of the vowels
    in <i>aer</i>, <i>deus</i>, <i>coit</i>, <i>duo</i>. To these
    add <i>Graius</i>.</p>

    <p>The rule of <i>apex</i> applies also to words of more than
    two syllables with long penultima, as <i>gravamen</i>,
    <i>arena</i>, <i>saliva</i>, <i>abdomen</i>, <i>acumen</i>. The
    rule of <i>aer</i> also holds good though it hardly has other
    instances than Greek names, as <i>Macháon</i>, <i>Ænéas</i>,
    <i>Thalía</i>, <i>Achelóus</i>, <i>Achæ&#769;i</i>.</p>

    <p>In words of more than two syllables with short penultima the
    vowel in the stressed antepenultima was pronounced short when
    there was a consonant between the two last vowels, and <i>i</i>
    and <i>y</i> were short even when no consonant stood in that
    place. Examples are <i>stamina</i>, <i>Sexagesima</i>,
    <i>minimum</i>, <i>modicum</i>, <i>tibia</i>, <i>Polybius</i>.
    But <i>u</i>, <i>au</i>, <i>eu</i> were, as usual, exceptions,
    as <i>tumulus</i>, <i>Aufidus</i>, <i>Eutychus</i>. I believe
    that originally men said <i>Cæ&#774;sarem</i>, as they
    certainly said <i>cæ&#774;spitem</i> and <i>Cæ&#774;tulum</i>,
    as also <i>Cæ&#774;sarea</i>, but here in familiar words the
    cases came to follow the nominative.</p>

    <p>Exceptions to the rule were verb forms which had
    <i>&#257;v</i>, <i>&#275;v</i>, <i>&#299;v</i>, or
    <i>&#333;v</i> in the antepenultima, as <i>am&#257;veram</i>,
    <i>defieverat</i>, <i>audivero</i>, <i>moveras</i>, and like
    forms from aorists with the penultima long, as <i>suaseram</i>,
    <i>egero</i>, <i>miserat</i>, <i>roseras</i>, and their
    compounds.</p>

    <p>This rule was among the first to break down, and about the
    middle of the nineteenth century the Westminster Play began to
    observe the true quantities in the antepenultimate syllables.
    Thus in spite of 'cons&#301;deration' boys said
    <i>s&#299;dera</i>, and in spite of 'n&#335;minal' they said
    <i>nômina</i>, while they still said <i>s&#335;litus</i> and
    <i>r&#259;pidus</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>

    <p>On the other hand the following rule, of which borrowed
    words provide many examples, still obtains in the Play. In
    words of more than two syllables any vowel in the antepenultima
    other than <i>i</i> or <i>y</i> was pronounced long if no
    consonant divided the two following vowels. Possibly the reason
    was that there was a synæresis of the two vowels, but I doubt
    this, for a parasitic <i>y</i> was treated as a consonant.
    Examples are <i>alias</i>, <i>genius</i>, <i>odium</i>,
    <i>junior</i>, <i>anæmia</i>, and on the other hand
    <i>f&#301;lius</i>, <i>Ly&#774;dia</i>. Compound verbs with a
    short prefix were exceptions, as <i>&#335;beo</i>,
    <i>r&#277;creo</i>, whence our 'recreant'. A long prefix
    remained long as in <i>d&#275;sino</i>. The only other
    exception that I can remember was <i>Ph&#335;loe</i>.</p>

    <p>In polysyllables the general rule was that all vowels and
    diphthongs before the penultima other than <i>u</i>, when it
    bore a primary or secondary stress, and <i>au</i> and <i>eu</i>
    were pronounced short except where the 'alias' rule or the
    'larva' rule applied. Thus we said
    <i>h&#277;r&#277;ditaritis</i>, <i>æ&#774;qu&#259;bilitas</i>,
    <i>imb&#277;cillus</i>, <i>susp&#301;cionem</i>, but
    <i>fid&#363;ciarius</i>, <i>m&#275;diocritas</i>,
    <i>p&#257;rticipare</i>. I do not know why the popular voice
    now gives <i>&#258;riadne</i>, for our forefathers said
    <i>&#256;riadne</i> as they said <i>&#257;rea</i>.</p>

    <p>In very long words the alternation of stress and no-stress
    was insisted on. I remember a schoolmaster who took his degree
    at Oxford in the year 1827 reproving a boy for saying
    <i>Álphesib&oelig;&#769;us</i> instead of
    <i>Alphesib&oelig;&#769;us</i>, and I suspect that Wordsworth
    meant no inverted stress in</p>

    <p>though I hope that they did.</p>

    <p>It is not to be thought that these rules were in any way
    arbitrary. So little was this so that, I believe, they were
    never even formulated. If examples with the quantities marked
    were ever given, they must have been for the use of foreigners
    settling in England. English boys did not want rules, and their
    teachers could not really have given them. The teachers did not
    understand that each vowel represented not two sounds only, a
    long and a short, but many more. This fact was no more
    understood by John Walker, the actor and lexicographer, who in
    1798 published a Key to the Classical Pronunciation of Greek
    and Latin proper names. His general rule was wrong as a general
    rule, and so far as it agreed with facts it was useless. He
    says that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span> when a vowel ends a syllable
       it is long, and when it does not it is short. Apart from the
       confusion of cause and effect there is the error of
       identifying for instance the <i>e</i> in <i>beatus</i> and
       the <i>e</i> in <i>habebat</i>. Moreover, Walker confounds
       the <i>u</i> in 'curfew', really long, with the short and
       otherwise different <i>u</i> in 'but'. The rule was useless
       as a guide, for it did not say whether <i>moneo</i> for
       instance was to be read as <i>ino-neo</i> or as
       <i>mon-eo</i>, and therefore whether the <i>o</i> was to be
       long or short. Even Walker's list is no exact guide. He
       gives for instance <i>M&#333;-na</i>, which is right, and
       <i>M&#333;-næses</i>, which is not. Now without going into
       the difference between long vowels and ordinary vowels, of
       which latter some are long in scansion and some short, it is
       clear that there is no identity. In fact <i>Mona</i>, has
       the long <i>o</i> of 'moan' and <i>Monæses</i> the ordinary
       <i>o</i> of 'monaster'. A boy at school was not troubled by
       these matters. He had only two things to learn, first the
       quantity of the penultimate unit, second the fact that a
       final vowel was pronounced. When he knew these two things he
       gave the Latin word the sounds which it would have if it
       were an English word imported from the Latin. Thus he finds
       the word <i>civilitate</i>. I am not sure that he could find
       it, but that does not matter. He would know 'civility', and
       he learns that the penultima of the Latin word is long.
       Therefore he says
       <i>c&#301;v&#301;l&#301;t&#257;t&#277;</i>. Again he knows
       '&#301;nf&#301;n&#301;t' (I must be allowed to spell the
       word as it is pronounced except in corrupt quires). He finds
       that the penultima of <i>infinitivus</i> is long, and he
       therefore says <i>&#301;nf&#301;n&#301;t&#299;v&#365;s</i>.
       Again he knows 'irradiate', and finding that the penultima
       of <i>irradiabitur</i> is short he says
       <i>&#301;rr&#257;d&#301;&#259;b&#301;t&#365;r</i>. It is
       true that some of these verb forms under the influence of
       their congeners came to have an exceptional pronunciation.
       Thus <i>irradi&#257;bit</i> led at last to
       <i>irradi&#257;bitur</i>, but I doubt whether this occurred
       before the nineteenth century. The word <i>dabitur</i>,
       almost naturalized by Luther's adage of <i>date et
       dabitur</i>, kept its short <i>a</i> down to the time when
       it regained it, in a slightly different form, by its Roman
       right; and <i>am&#259;mini</i> and <i>mon&#277;mini</i> were
       unwavering in their use. Old people said
       <i>v&#257;ri&#259;bilis</i> long after the true quantities
       had asserted themselves, and the word as the specific name
       of a plant may be heard even now. Its first syllable of
       course follows what I shall call the 'alias' rule. We may
       still see this rule in other instances. All men say
       'hippopót&#259;mus', and even those who know that this
       <i>a</i> is short in Greek can say nothing but
       'Mesopot&#257;mia', unless indeed the word
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span> lose its blessed and
       comforting powers in a disyllabic abbreviation. When a
       country was named after Cecil Rhodes, where the <i>e</i> in
       the surname is mute, we all called it 'Rhod&#275;sia'. Had
       it been named after a Newman, where the <i>a</i> is short or
       rather obscure, we should all have called it 'Newm&#257;nia
       ', while, named after a Davis, it would certainly have been
       'Dav&#301;sia'. The process of thought would in each case
       have been unconscious. A new example is 'aviation', whose
       first vowel has been instinctively lengthened.</p>

    <p>Again, when the word 'telegram' was coined, some scholars
    objected to its formation and insisted upon 'telegrapheme', but
    the most obdurate Grecian did not propose to keep the long
    Greek vowel in the first syllable. When only the other day
    'cinematograph' made its not wholly desirable appearance, it
    made no claim to a long vowel in either of its two first
    syllables. Not till it was reasonably shortened into
    'c&#301;n&#277;ma' did a Judge from the Bench make a lawless
    decree for a long second vowel, and even he left the <i>i</i>
    short though it is long in Greek.</p>

    <p>Of course with the manner of speech the quantities had to be
    learnt separately. The task was not as difficult as some may
    think. To boys with a taste for making verses the thumbing of a
    Gradus (I hope that no one calls it a Gr&#259;dus) was always a
    delightful occupation, and a quantity once learnt was seldom
    forgotten. It must be admitted that, as boys were forced to do
    verses, whether they could or not, there were always some who
    could read and yet forget.</p>

    <p>Although these usages did not precede but followed the
    pronunciation of words already borrowed from Latin, we may use
    them to classify the changes of quantity. We shall see that
    although there are some exceptions for which it is difficult to
    give a reason, yet most of the exceptions fall under two
    classes. When words came to us through French, the
    pronunciation was often affected by the French form of the
    word. Thus the adjective 'present' would, if it had come direct
    from Latin, have had a long vowel in the first syllable. To an
    English ear 'pr&#277;sent' seemed nearer than 'pr&#275;sent' to
    the French 'présent'. The <i>N.E.D.</i> says that 'gladiator'
    comes straight from the Latin 'gladiatorem'. Surely in that
    case it would have had its first vowel long, as in 'radiator'
    and 'mediator'. In any case its pronunciation must have been
    affected by 'gladiateur'. The other class of exceptions
    consists of words deliberately introduced
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span> by writers at a late period.
       Thus 'adorable' began as a penman's word. Following
       'inéxorable' and the like it should have been 'ádorable'.
       Actually it was formed by adding <i>-able</i> to 'adóre',
       like 'laughable'. It is now too stiff in the joints to think
       of a change, and must continue to figure with the other sins
       of the Restoration.</p>

    <p>Before dealing with the words as classified by their
    formation, we may make short lists of typical words to show
    that for the pronunciation of English derivatives it is idle to
    refer to the classical quantities.</p>

    <p>The <i>N.E.D.</i> prefers the spelling '&oelig;cumenical';
    but Newman wrote naturally 'ecumenical', and so does Dr. J.B.
    Bury. Dublin scholarship has in this matter been markedly
    correct.</p>

    <h4><i>Classification of words according to their Latin
    stems.</i></h4>

    <p>In classification it seems simplest to take the words
    according to their Latin stems. We must, however, first deal
    with a class of adjectives borrowed bodily from the Latin
    nominative masculine with the insertion of a meaningless
    <i>o</i> before the final <i>-us</i>.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       These of course follow the rules given above. In words of
       more than two syllables the antepenultimate and stressed
       vowel is shortened, as '&#277;mulous'
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span> from <i>æmulus</i> and in
       'fr&#301;volous' from <i>fr&#299;volus</i>, except where by
       the 'alias' rule it is long, as in 'egr&#275;gious' from
       <i>egr&#277;gius</i>. Words coined on this analogy also
       follow the rules. Thus 'glabrous' and 'fibrous' have the
       vowels long, as in the traditional pronunciation of
       <i>glabrum</i> and <i>fibrum</i>, where the vowels in
       classical Latin were short. The stressed <i>u</i> being
       always long we have 'lug&#363;brious' and 'sal&#363;brious',
       the length being independent of the 'alias' rule. Some words
       ending in <i>-ous</i> are not of this class. Thus 'odorous'
       and 'clamorous' appear in Italian as <i>odoroso</i> and
       <i>clamoroso</i>. Milton has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Sonórous mettal blowing Martial sounds.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The Italian is <i>sonoro</i>, and our word was simply the
    Latin <i>sonorus</i> borrowed bodily at a somewhat late period.
    Hence the stress remains on the penultima. Skeat thought that
    the word would at last become 'sónorous'. It maybe hoped that
    Milton's line will save it from the effect of a false
    analogy.</p>

    <p>In classifying by stems it will be well to add, where
    possible, words of Greek origin. Except in some late
    introductions Greek words, except when introduced bodily, have
    been treated as if they came through Latin, and some of the
    bodily introductions are in the same case. Thus 'anæsthetic' is
    spelt with the Latin diphthong and the Latin <i>c</i>. Even
    'skeleton' had a <i>c</i> to start with, while the modern and
    wholly abominable 'kaleidoscope' is unprincipled on the face of
    it.</p>

    <p><b>Stems ending in -ant and -ent.</b> These are participles
    or words formed as such. Our words have shed a syllable, thus
    <i>regentem</i> has become 'regent'. Disyllables follow the
    'apex' rule and lengthen the first vowel, as 'agent', 'decent',
    'potent'. Exceptions are 'clement' and 'present', perhaps under
    French influence. Words of more than two syllables with a
    single consonant before the termination throw the stress back
    and shorten a long penultima, as 'ignorant', 'president',
    'confident', 'adjutant'. Where there are two heavy consonants,
    the stress remains on the penultima, as 'consultant',
    'triumphant', even when one of the consonants is not
    pronounced, as 'reminiscent'. In some cases the Latinists seem
    to have deliberately altered the natural pronunciation. Thus
    Gower has 'ápparaúnt', but the word became 'appárent' before
    Shakespeare's time, and later introductions such as 'adherent'
    followed it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span> What right 'adjacent' has to
       its long vowel and penultimate stress I do not know, but it
       cannot be altered now.</p>

    <p><b>Stems ending in -ato and -uto.</b> These are mostly past
    participles, but many of them are used in English as verbs. It
    must be admitted that the disyllabic words are not wholly
    constant to a principle. Those verbs that come from
    <i>-latum</i> consistently stress the last vowel, as 'dilate',
    'relate', 'collate'. So does 'create', because of one vowel
    following another. Of the rest all the words of any rank have
    the stress on the penultima, as 'vibrate', 'frustrate',
    'mígrate', 'cástrate', 'púlsate', 'vácate'. Thus Pope has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The whisper, that to greatness still too near,</p>

            <p>Perhaps, yet vibrates on his Sov'reign's ear,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and Shelley</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Music, when soft voices die,</p>

            <p>Vibrates in the memory.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>There are, however, verbs of no literary account which in
    usage either vary in the stress or take it on the latter
    syllable. Such are 'locate', 'orate', 'negate', 'placate', and
    perhaps 'rotate'. With most of these we could well dispense.
    'Equate' is mainly a technical word. Dictionaries seem to
    prefer the stress on the ultima, but some at least of the early
    Victorian mathematicians said 'équate', and the pronunciation
    is to be supported. Trisyllabic verbs throw the stress back and
    shorten the penultima, as 'dés&#335;late', 'súff&#335;cate',
    'scínt&#301;llate'. Even words with heavy double consonants
    have adopted this habit. Thus where Browning has (like Milton
    and Cowper)</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I the Trinity illústrate</p>

            <p class="i2">Drinking water'd orange pulp,</p>

            <p>In three sips the Arian frustrate.</p>

            <p class="i2">While he drains his at one gulp,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>it is now usual to say 'íllustrate'.</p>

    <p>Adjectives of this class take as early a stress as they can,
    as 'órnate', 'pínnate', 'délicate', 'fórtunate'. Nouns from all
    these words throw the accent back and shorten or obscure all
    but the penultimate vowel, as 'ignorance', 'evaporation'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -ia.</b> Here even disyllables shorten the
    penultima, as 'copy', 'province', while longer words throw the
    stress back as well as shorten the penultima, as 'injury',
    'colony', while 'ignominy' almost lost its penultimate vowel,
    and therefore threw back the stress to the first
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span> syllable. Shakespeare frankly
       writes the word as a trisyllable,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Thy ignomy sleep with thee in the grave.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Milton restored the lost syllable, often eliding the final
    vowel, as in</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Even with heavy consonants we have the early stress, as in
    'industry'. Greek words follow the same rules, as 'agony',
    'melody'. Some words of this class have under French influence
    been further abbreviated, as 'concord'.</p>

    <p>Corresponding <b>stems in -io</b> keep the same rules.
    Perhaps the only disyllable is 'study'; the shortening of a
    stressed <i>u</i> shows its immediate derivation from the old
    French <i>estudie</i>. Trisyllabic examples are 'colloquy',
    'ministry', 'perjury'. Many words of this class have been
    further abbreviated in their passage through French. Such are
    'benefice', 'divorce', 'office', 'presage', 'suffrage',
    'vestige', 'adverb', 'homicide', 'proverb'. The stress in
    'divórce' is due to the long vowel and the two consonants. A
    few of these words have been borrowed bodily from Latin, as
    'odium', 'tedium', 'opprobrium'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -do and -to (-so).</b> These words lose the
    final Latin syllable and keep the stress on the vowel which
    bore it in Latin. The stressed vowel, except in <i>au</i>,
    <i>eu</i>, is short, even when, as in 'vivid', 'florid', it was
    long in classical Latin. This, of course, is in accord with the
    English pronunciation of Latin. Examples are 'acid', 'tepid',
    'rigid', 'horrid', 'humid', 'lurid ', 'absurd', 'tacit',
    'digit', 'deposit', 'compact', 'complex', 'revise', 'response',
    'acute'. Those which have the suffix <i>-es</i> prefixed throw
    the stress back, as 'honest', 'modest'. Those which have the
    suffix <i>-men</i> prefixed also throw the stress back, as
    'moment', 'pigment', 'torment', and to the antepenultima, if
    there be one, as 'argument', 'armament', 'emolument', the
    penultimate vowel becoming short or obscure. In 'temperament'
    the tendency of the second syllable to disappear has carried
    the stress still further back. We may compare 'Séptuagint',
    where <i>u</i> becomes consonantal. An exception for which I
    cannot account is 'cemént', but Shakespeare has 'cément'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -t&#257;t.</b> These are nouns and have the
    stress on the antepenultima, which in Latin bore the secondary
    stress. They of course show the usual shortening of the vowels
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span> with the usual exceptions.
       Examples are 'charity', 'equity', 'liberty', 'ferocity',
       'authority', and with long antepenultima 'immunity',
       'security', 'university'. With no vowel before the penultima
       the long quality is, as usual, preserved, as in
       'satiety'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -oso.</b> These are adjectives and throw the
    stress back to the antepenultima, if there be one. In
    disyllables the penultimate vowel is long, as in 'famous',
    'vinous'; in longer words the antepenultimate vowel is short,
    as 'criminous', 'generous'. Many, however, fall under the
    'alias' rule, as 'ingenious', 'odious', while those which have
    <i>i</i> in the penultimate run the two last syllables into
    one, as 'pernicious', 'religious', 'vicious'. A few late
    introductions, coming straight from the Latin, retained the
    Latin stress, as 'morose', 'verbose'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -t&#333;rio and -s&#333;rio.</b> In these words
    the stress goes back to the fourth syllable from the end, this
    in Latin having the secondary stress, or, as in 'circulatory',
    'ambulatory', even further. In fact the <i>o</i>, which of
    course is shortened, tends to disappear. Examples are
    'declamatory', 'desultory', 'oratory', 'predatory',
    'territory'. Three consonants running, as in 'perfunctory',
    keep the stress where it has to be in a trisyllable, such as
    'victory'. So does a long vowel before <i>r</i> and another
    consonant, as in 'precursory'. Otherwise two consonants have
    not this effect, as in 'prómontory', 'cónsistory'. In spite of
    Milton's</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>A gloomy Consistory, and them amidst</p>

            <p>With looks agast and sad he thus bespake,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>the word is sometimes mispronounced.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -&#257;rio.</b> These follow the same rules,
    except that, as in 'ádversary', combinations like <i>ers</i>
    are shortened and the stress goes back; and that words ending
    in <i>-entary</i>, such as 'elementary' and 'testamentary',
    stress the antepenultima. Examples are 'antiquary', 'honorary',
    'voluntary', 'emissary'. It is difficult to see a reason for an
    irregular quantity in the antepenultima of some trisyllables.
    The general rule makes it short, as in 'granary', 'salary', but
    in 'library' and 'notary' it has been lengthened. The
    <i>N.E.D.</i> gives 'pl&#275;nary', but our grandfathers said
    'pl&#277;nary'. Of course 'diary' gives a long quality to the
    <i>i</i>.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -&#301;li.</b> These seem originally to have
    retained the short <i>i</i>. Thus Milton's spelling is 'facil'
    and 'fertil' while other seventeenth-century writers give
    'steril'. This <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span> pronunciation still obtains
       in America, but in England the words seem to have been
       usually assimilated to 'fragile', as Milton spells it, which
       perhaps always lengthened the vowel. The penultimate vowel
       is short.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -&#299;li.</b> Here the long <i>i</i> is
    retained, and in disyllables the penultima is lengthened, as in
    'anile', 'senile', 'virile'. There is no excuse for following
    the classical quantity in the former syllables of any of these
    words. As an English word 'sedilia' shortens the
    antepenultimate, like 'tibia' and the rest, the 'alias' rule
    not applying when the vowel is <i>i</i>.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -b&#301;li.</b> These mostly come through French
    and change the suffix into <i>-ble</i>. Disyllables lengthen
    the penultima, as 'able', 'stable', 'noble', while 'mobile', as
    in French, lengthens its latter vowel. Trisyllables shorten and
    stress the antepenultima, as 'placable', 'equable', but of
    course <i>u</i> remains long, as in 'mutable'. Longer words
    throw the stress further back, except mere negatives, like
    'implácable', and words with heavy consonants such as
    'delectable'. Examples are 'miserable', 'admirable',
    'intolerable', 'despicable'. The Poet Laureate holds that in
    these words Milton kept the long Italian <i>a</i> of the
    penultimate or secondary stress.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In English we have naturalized <i>-able</i> as a suffix and
    added it to almost any verb, as 'laughable', 'indescribable',
    'desirable'. The last word may have been taken from French. The
    form 'des&#301;derable' occurs from the fourteenth to the
    seventeenth century. Originally 'acceptable' threw the stress
    back, as in Milton's</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>but the double mute has brought it into line with
    'delectable'. Nowadays one sometimes hears 'dispútable',
    'despícable', but these are intolerable vulgarisms.</p>

    <p><b>Suffixes in t&#301;li and s&#301;li.</b> These words
    mostly lengthen the <i>i</i> and make the usual shortenings, as
    'missile', 'sessile', 'textile', 'volatile', but of course
    'futile'. Exceptions which I cannot explain are 'foss&#301;l'
    and 'fus&#301;le'.</p>

    <p><b>Suffix in &#257;li.</b> These adjectives shorten the
    <i>-a</i> and, with the usual exceptions, the preceding vowels,
    as 'dóctrinal', 'fílial', 'líberal', 'márital', 'medícinal',
    but of course by the 'alias' rule 'arb&#333;real' (not a
    classical word in Latin) and 'g&#275;nial'. Words like
    'national' and 'rational' were
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span> treated like trisyllables,
       which they now are. The stress is on the antepenultima
       except when heavy consonants bring it on to the penultima,
       as in 'sepulcral', 'parental', 'triumphal'.</p>

    <p>Those who say 'doctrínal' on the ground that the second
    vowel is long in Latin commit themselves to 'medicínal',
    'natúral', 'nutríment', 'instrúment', and, if their own
    principle be applied, they make false quantities by the dozen
    every day of their lives.</p>

    <p>Three words mostly mispronounced are, from their rarity,
    perhaps not past rescue. They are 'décanal', 'ruridécanal', and
    'prébendal'. There is no more reason for saying 'decánal' than
    for saying 'matrónal' or for saying 'prebéndal' than for saying
    'caléndar'. Of course words like 'tremendous', being imported
    whole, keep the original stress. In our case the Latin words
    came into existence as <i>décanális</i>, <i>prébendális</i>,
    parallel with <i>náturális</i>, which gives us 'nátural'. That
    mostly wrong-headed man, Burgon of Chichester, was correct in
    speaking of his rights or at any rate his claims as
    'décanal'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -lo.</b> Of these 'stimulus' and 'villa' have
    been borrowed whole, while <i>umbella</i> is corrupted into
    'umbrella'. Disyllables lengthen the penultima, as 'stable',
    'title', 'pupil'. Under French influence 'disciple' follows
    their example. In longer words the usual shortenings are made,
    as in 'frivolous', 'ridiculous'. The older words in <i>-ulo</i>
    change the suffix into <i>-le</i>, as 'uncle', 'maniple',
    'tabernacle', 'conventicle', 'receptacle', 'panicle'. Later
    words retain the <i>u</i>, as 'vestibule', 'reticule',
    'molecule'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -no.</b> The many words of this class are a
    grief to the classifier, who seeks in vain for reasons. Thus
    'german' and 'germane' have the same source and travelled, it
    seems, by the same road through France. The Latin
    <i>hyacinth&#301;nus</i> and <i>adamant&#301;nus</i> are
    parallel words, yet Milton has 'hyacinthin' for the one and
    'adamantine' for the other. One classification goes a little
    way. Thus 'human' and 'urban' must have come through French,
    'humane' and 'urbane' direct from Latin. On the other hand
    while 'meridian' and 'quartan' are French, 'publican',
    'veteran', and 'oppidan' are Latin. Words with a long <i>i</i>,
    if they came early through France, shorten the vowel, as
    'doctrine', 'discipline', 'medicine', and 'masculine', while
    'genuine', though a later word, followed them, but 'anserine'
    and 'leonine' did not. Disyllables seem to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span> prefer the stress on the
       ultima, as 'divine', 'supine', but even these are not
       consistent. Some critics would scan Cassio's words</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The dívine Desdemona,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>though Shakespeare nowhere else has this stress, while
    Shelley has. Shelley, too, has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>She cannot know how well the súpine slaves</p>

            <p>Of blind authority read the truth of things.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The grammatical term, too, is 'súpine'. Later introductions
    also have this stress, as 'bóvine', 'cánine', 'équine'. The
    last word is not always understood. At any rate
    Halliwell-Phillips, referring to a well-known story of
    Shakespeare's youth, says that the poet probably attended the
    theatre 'in some equine capacity'. As it is agreed that
    'bovine' and 'equine' lengthen the former vowel, we ought by
    analogy to say 'c&#257;nine', as probably most people do. Words
    of more than two syllables have the stress on the antepenultima
    and the vowel is short, as in 'libertine', 'adulterine', but of
    course '&#363;terine'. When heavy consonants bring the stress
    on to the penultima, the <i>i</i> is shortened, as in
    'clandest&#301;n(e)', 'intest&#301;n(e)', and so in like
    disyllables, as 'doctr&#301;n(e)'. The modern words
    'morphin(e)' and 'strychnin(e)', coined, the one from Morpheus
    and the other from the Greek name of the plant known to
    botanists as <i>Withania somnifera</i>, correctly follow
    'doctrine' in shortening the <i>i</i>, though another
    pronunciation is sometimes heard.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -tudin.</b> These shorten the antepenultima, as
    'plenitude', 'solitude', with the usual exceptions, such as
    'fortitude'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -tion.</b> These words retain the suffix, which
    in early days was disyllabic, as it sometimes is in
    Shakespeare, for instance in Portia's</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Before a friend of this descriptión</p>

            <p>Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Thus they came under the 'alias' rule, and what is now the
    penultimate vowel is long unless it be <i>i</i>. Examples are
    'nation', 'accretion', 'emotion', 'solution', while <i>i</i> is
    shortened in 'petition', 'munition', and the like, and left
    short in 'admonition' and others. In military use an exception
    is made by 'ration', but the pronunciation is confined to one
    sense of the word, and is new at that. I remember old soldiers
    of George III who spoke of 'r&#257;tions'. Perhaps the ugly
    change is due to French
    influence.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>

    <p>Originally the adjectives from these words must have
    lengthened the fourth vowel from the end long, as
    n&#257;t&#301;&#335;nal, but when <i>ti</i> became <i>sh</i>
    they came to follow the rule of Latin trisyllables in our
    pronunciation.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -ic.</b> Of these words we have a good many,
    both Latin and Greek. Those that came direct keep the stress on
    the vowel which was antepenultimate and is in English
    penultimate, and this vowel is short whatever its original
    quantity. Examples are 'aquatic', 'italic', 'Germanic'. Words
    that came through French threw the stress back, as 'lúnatic'.
    Skeat says that 'fanatic' came through French, but he can
    hardly be right, for the pronunciation 'fánatic' is barely
    three score years old. There is no inverted stress in
    Milton's</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Fanátic Egypt and her priests.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>As for 'unique' it is a modern borrowing from French, and of
    late 'ántique' or 'ántic', as Shakespeare has it, has followed
    in one of its senses the French use. It is a pity in face of
    Milton's</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>With mask and ántique Pageantry,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and it obscures the etymological identity of 'antique' and
    'antic', but the old pronunciation is irredeemable. At least
    the new avoids the homophonic inconvenience.</p>

    <p>Greek words of this class used as adjectives mostly follow
    the same rule, as 'sporadic', 'dynamic', 'pneumatic',
    'esoteric', 'philanthropic', 'emetic', 'panegyric'. As nouns
    the earlier introductions threw the stress back, as 'heretic',
    'arithmetic', but later words follow the adjectives, as
    'emetic', 'enclitic', 'panegyric'. As for 'politic', which is
    stressed as we stress both by Shakespeare and by Milton, it
    must be under French influence, though Skeat seems to think
    that it came straight from Latin.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -os.</b> These words agree in being disyllabic,
    but otherwise they are a tiresome and quarrelsome people. For
    their diversity in spelling some can make a defence, since
    'horror', 'pallor', 'stupor' came straight from Latin, but
    'tenor', coming through French, should have joined hands with
    'colour', 'honour', 'odour'. The short vowel is inevitable in
    'horror' and 'pallor', the long in 'ardour', 'stupor',
    'tumour'. The rest are at war, 'clamour', 'colour', 'honour',
    'dolour', 'rigour', 'squalor', 'tenor', 'vigour' in the short
    legion, 'favour', 'labour', 'odour', 'vapour' in the long.
    Their camp-followers ending in -ous are under their
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span> discipline, so that, while
       'cl&#259;morous', 'r&#301;gorous', 'v&#301;gorous' agree
       with the general rule, '&#333;dorous' makes an exception to
       it. All the derivatives of <i>favor</i> are exceptions to
       the general rule, for 'favourite' and 'favorable' keep its
       long <i>a</i>. Of course 'l&#259;b&#333;rious' is quite in
       order, and so is 'v&#259;pid'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -tor and -sor.</b> These words, when they came
    through French, threw the stress back and shortened the
    penultimate, <i>&#333;r&#257;torem</i> becoming <i>orateur</i>,
    and then '&#335;r&#259;tor', with the stress on the
    antepenultimate. Others of the same type are 'auditor',
    'competitor', 'senator', and Shelley has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>The sister-pest, congrégator of slaves,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>while 'amateur' is borrowed whole from French and stresses
    its ultima. Trisyllables of course shorten the first vowel, as
    'cr&#277;ditor', 'j&#259;nitor'. Polysyllables follow the
    stress of the verbs; thus 'ágitate' gives 'ágitator' and
    'compóse' gives 'compósitor'. To the first class belongs
    'circulator', 'educator', 'imitator', 'moderator',
    'negotiator', 'prevaricator', with which 'gladiator' associates
    itself; to the second belongs 'competitor'. Words which came
    straight from Latin keep the stress of the Latin nominative, as
    'creator', 'spectator', 'testator', 'coadjutor', 'assessor', to
    which in Walton's honour must be added 'Piscator' and
    'Venator'. On 'curator' he who decides does so at his peril. On
    one occasion Eldon from the Bench corrected Erskine for saying
    'cúr&#259;tor'. 'Cur&#257;tor, Mr. Erskine, cur&#257;tor.' 'I
    am glad', was the reply, 'to be set right by so eminent a
    sen&#257;tor and so eloquent an or&#257;tor as your Lordship.'
    Neither eminent lawyer knew much about it, but each was so far
    right that he stuck to the custom of his country. On other
    grounds Erskine might be thought to have committed himself to
    'tést&#259;tor', if not quite to the 'testy tricks' of Sally in
    Mrs. Gaskell's 'Ruth'.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -ero and -uro.</b> Adjectives of this type keep
    the Latin stress, which thus falls on the ultima, and shorten
    or obscure the penultimate vowel, as 'mature', 'obscure',
    'severe', 'sincere', but of course '&#257;ustere'. Of like form
    though of other origin is 'secure'. Nouns take an early stress,
    as 'áperture', 'sépulture', 'líterature', 'témperature', unless
    two mutes obstruct, as in 'conjécture'. Of the disyllables
    'nature' keeps a long penultima, while 'figure' has it short,
    not because of the Latin quantity, but because of the
    French.</p>

    <p>The lonely word 'mediocre' lengthens its first vowel by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span> the 'alias' rule and also
       stresses it. Whether the penultima has more than a secondary
       stress is a matter of dispute.</p>

    <p><b>Stems in -ari.</b> These words have the stress on the
    antepenultima, which they shorten, as in 'secular' or keep
    short as in 'jocular', 'familiar', but of course
    'pec&#363;liar'.</p>

    <h4><i>On certain Greek words.</i></h4>

    <p>It will have been seen that Greek words are usually treated
    as Latin. Thus 'crisis' lengthens the penultima under the
    'apex' rule, while 'critical' has it short under the general
    rule of polysyllables. Other examples of lengthening are
    'bathos', 'pathos', while the long quantity is of course kept
    in 'colon' and 'crasis'. For the 'alias' rule we may quote
    '&#257;theist', 'cryptog&#257;mia', 'h&#333;meopathy',
    'heterog&#275;neous', 'pandem&#333;nium', while the normal
    shortenings are found in 'an&#335;nymous', 'eph&#277;meral',
    'pand&#277;monium', '&#277;r&#277;mite'. Ignorance of English
    usage has made some editors flounder on a line of Pope's:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Yes, or we must renounce the Stagirite.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The birthplace of Aristotle was of course Stag&#299;ra or,
    as it is now fashionable to transcribe it, Stageira, as Pope
    doubtless knew, but the editors who accuse him of a false
    quantity in Greek are on the contrary themselves guilty of one
    in English. The penultima in English is short whether it was
    long or, as in 'dynamite' and 'malachite', short in Greek.</p>

    <p>There is, however, one distinct class of Greek words in
    which the Latin rule is not followed. In the sixteenth and
    seventeenth centuries there were scholars who rightly or
    wrongly treated the Greek accent as a mark of stress. It is
    clear that this habit led to an inability to maintain a long
    quantity in an unstressed syllable. Shakespeare must have
    learnt his little Greek from a scholar who had this habit, for
    he writes 'Andrón&#301;cus' and also</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I am misánthr&#335;pos and hate mankind.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Of course all scholars shortened the first vowel of the
    word, and doubtless Shakespeare shortened also the third. Busby
    also thus spoke Greek with the result that Dryden in later life
    sometimes wrote epsilon instead of eta and also spoke of
    'Cleoménes' and 'Iphig&#275;n&#301;a'. As a boy at Westminster
    he wrote</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Learn'd, Vertuous, Pious, Great, and have by
            this</p>

            <p>An universal Metempsuchosis.</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>

    <p>Macaulay with an ignorance very unusual in him rebuked his
    nephew for saying 'metamórph&#335;sis', and Dr. Johnson, had he
    been living, would have rebuked Macaulay. For the sake of our
    poets we ought to save 'apothé&#335;sis', which is in some
    danger. Garth may perhaps be forgotten,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Allots the prince of his celestial line</p>

            <p>An Apotheosis and rights divine,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>but 'Rejected Addresses' should still carry weight. In the
    burlesque couplet, ascribed in the first edition to the younger
    Colman and afterwards transferred to Theodore Hook, we have</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>That John and Mrs. Bull from ale and tea-houses</p>

            <p>May shout huzza for Punch's apotheosis.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It need hardly be said that 'tea-houses' like 'grandfathers'
    has the stress on the antepenultimate.</p>

    <p>There are other words of Greek origin which now break the
    rules, though I believe the infringement to be quite modern.
    First we have the class beginning with <i>proto</i>. It can
    hardly be doubted that our ancestors followed rule and said
    'pr&#335;tocol', and 'pr&#335;totype', and I suspect also
    'pr&#335;tomartyr'. There seems, however, to be a general
    agreement nowadays to keep the Greek omega. As for
    'protagonist' the word is so technical and is often so
    ludicrously misunderstood that writers on the Greek drama would
    do well to retain the Greek termination and say
    'protagonistes'; for 'protagonist' is very commonly mistaken
    and used for the opposite of 'antagonist'.</p>

    <p>Next come words beginning with <i>hypo</i> or <i>hyph</i>.
    In a disyllable the vowel is long by the 'apex' rule, as in
    'hyphen'. In longer words it should be short. So once it was,
    and we still say 'hypocaust', 'hypocrit', 'hypochondria'
    (whence 'hypped'), 'hypothesis', and others, but a large group
    of technical and scientific words seems determined to have a
    long <i>y</i>. It looks as though there were a belief that
    <i>y</i> is naturally long, though the French influence which
    gives us 't&#563;rant' does not extend to 'tyranny'. I do not
    know what Mr. Hardy calls his poem, but I hope he follows the
    old use and calls it 'The Dy&#774;nasts'. It might be thought
    that 'dy&#774;nasty' was safe, but it is not. Some modern words
    like 'dynamite' have been misused from their birth.</p>

    <p>Another class begins with <i>hydro-</i> from the Greek word
    for water. None of them seem to be very old, but probably
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span> 'hydraulic' began life with a
       short <i>y</i>. Surely Mrs. Malaprop, when she meant
       'hysterics' and said 'hydrostatics', must have used the
       short <i>y</i>. Of course 'hydra' which comes from the same
       root follows the 'apex' rule.</p>

    <p>Words beginning with <i>hyper-</i> seem nowadays always to
    have a long <i>y</i> except that one sometimes hears
    'hy&#774;perbole' and 'hy&#774;perbolical'. Of course both in
    <i>hypo-</i> and in <i>hyper-</i> the vowel is short in Greek,
    so that here at least the strange lengthening cannot be
    ascribed to the Grecians. The false theory of a long <i>y</i>
    has not affected 'cynic' or 'cynical', while 'Cyril' has been
    saved by being a Christian name. We may yet hope to retain
    <i>y</i> short in 'cylinder', 'cynosure', 'lycanthropy',
    'mythology', 'pyramid', 'pyrotechnic', 'sycamore', 'synonym',
    'typical'. As for 'h&#563;brid' it seems as much a caprice as
    '&#257;crid', a pronunciation often heard. Though 'acrid' is a
    false formation it ought to follow 'vivid' and 'florid'. The
    'alias' rule enforces a long <i>y</i> in 'hygiene' and
    'hygienic'.</p>

    <p>On the matter of Greek names the lettern and the pulpit are
    grievous offenders. Once it was not so. The clergymen of the
    old type and the scholars of the Oxford Retrogression said
    T&#301;m&#333;th&#277;&#365;s, because they had a sense of
    English and followed, consciously or unconsciously, the 'alias'
    rule. If there was ever an error, it was on the lips of some
    illiterate literate who made three syllables of the word. Now
    it seems fashionable to say T&#299;m&#335;th&#277;&#365;s. The
    literate was better than this, for he at least had no theory,
    and frank ignorance is to be forgiven. It is no shame to a man
    not to know that the second <i>i</i> in 'Villiers' is as mute
    as that in 'Parliament' or that Bolingbroke's name began with
    Bull and ended with brook, but when ignorance constructs a
    theory it is quite another matter. The etymological theory of
    pronunciation is intolerable. Etymology was a charming nymph
    even when men had but a distant acquaintance with her, and a
    nearer view adds to her graces; but when she is dragged
    reluctant from her element she flops like a stranded mermaid.
    The curate says 'Deuteronómy', and on his theory ought to say
    'económy' and 'etymológy'. When Robert Gomery&mdash;why not
    give the reverend poetaster his real if less elegant
    name&mdash;published his once popular work, every one called it
    'The Omnípresence of the Deïty', and Shelley had already
    written</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>And, as I look'd, the bright omnípresence</p>

            <p>Of morning through the orient cavern flowed.</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>

    <p>It is true that Ken a century earlier had committed himself
    to</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Thou while below wert yet on high</p>

            <p>By Omniprésent Deity,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and later Coleridge, perhaps characteristically, had sinned
    with</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>There is one Mind, one omniprésent Mind,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>but neither the bishop nor the poet would have said
    'omniscíence', or 'omnipótence'.</p>

    <p>Another word to show signs of etymological corruption is
    '&#277;volution'. It seems to have been introduced as a
    technical term of the art of war, and of course, like
    'd&#277;volution', shortened the <i>e</i>. The biologists first
    borrowed it and later seem desirous of corrupting it. Perhaps
    they think of such words as '&#275;gress', but the long vowel
    is right in the stressed penultimate.</p>

    <p>One natural tendency in English runs strongly against
    etymology. This is the tendency to throw the stress back, which
    about a century ago turned 'contémplate' into 'cóntemplate' and
    somewhat later 'illústrate' into 'íllustrate'. Shakespeare and
    Milton pronounced 'instinct' as we pronounce 'distinct' and
    'aspect' as we pronounce 'respect'. Thus Belarius is made to
    say</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i10">'Tis wonder</p>

            <p>That an invisible instínct should frame them</p>

            <p>To royalty unlearn'd,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and Milton has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>By this new felt attraction and instinct,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and also</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>In battailous aspéct and neerer view.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The retrogression of the stress is in these instances well
    established, and we cannot quarrel with it; but against some
    very recent instances a protest may be made. One seems to be a
    corruption of the War. In 1884 the <i>N.E.D.</i> recognized no
    pronunciation of it save 'allý', as in Romeo's</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>This gentleman, the prince's neer Alie.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The late Mr. B.B. Rogers in his translations of Aristophanes
    has of course no other pronunciation. His verses are too good
    to be spoiled by what began as a vulgarism. Another equally
    recent vulgarism, not recognized by the <i>N.E.D.</i> and bad
    enough to make George Russell turn in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span> his grave, is 'mágazine' for
       'magazíne'. It is not yet common, but such vulgarisms are
       apt to climb.</p>

    <p>In times not quite so recent the word 'prophecy' has
    changed, not indeed its stress, but the quantity of its final
    vowel. When Alford wrote 'The Queen's English', every one
    lengthened the last vowel, as in the verb, nor do I remember
    any other pronunciation in my boyhood. Now the <i>N.E.D.</i>
    gives the short vowel only. Alford to his own satisfaction
    accounted for the long vowel by the diphthong <i>ei</i> of the
    Greek. It is to be feared that his explanation would involve
    'dynast&#563;' and 'polic&#563;', even if it did not oblige us
    to turn 'Pompey' into 'Pomp&#563;'. In this case it may be
    suspected that the noun was assimilated to the verb, which
    follows the analogy of 'magnify' and 'multiply'. The voice of
    the people which now gives us 'prophecy&#774;' seems here to
    have felt the power of analogy and assuredly will prevail.</p>

    <h4><i>On proper names.</i></h4>

    <p>It is to be hoped that except in reading Latin and Greek
    texts we shall keep to the traditional pronunciation of proper
    names as it is enshrined in our poetry and other literature. We
    must continue to lengthen the stressed penultimate vowel in
    Athos, Cato, Draco, Eros, Hebrus, Lichas, Nero, Otho, Plato,
    Pylos, Remus, Samos, Titus, Venus, and the many other
    disyllables wherein it was short in the ancient tongues. On the
    other hand we shall shorten the originally long stressed
    antepenultimate vowel in Brasidas, Euripides, Icarus, Lavinia,
    Lucilius, Lydia, Nicias, Onesimus, Pegasus, Pyramus, Regulus,
    Romulus, Scipio, Sisyphus, Socrates, Thucydides, and many
    more.</p>

    <p>Quin, and the actors of his day, used to give to the first
    vowel in 'Cato' the sound of the <i>a</i> in 'father'. They
    probably thought that they were Italianizing such names. In
    fact their use was neither Latin nor English. They were like
    the men of to-day who speak of the town opposite Dover as
    'Cally', a name neither French nor English. A town which once
    sent members to the English Parliament has a right to an
    English name. Prior rhymed it with 'Alice' and Browning has</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>When Fortune's malice</p>

            <p>Lost her Calais.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Shakespeare, of course, spelt it 'Callis', and this form,
    which was first evicted by Pope, whom other editors servilely
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span> followed, ought to be
       restored to Shakespeare's text. In the pronunciation of Cato
       the stage regained the English diphthong in the mouth of
       Garrick, whose good sense was often in evidence. It is
       recorded that his example was not at once followed in
       Scotland or Ireland. If there was any Highlander on the
       stage it may be hoped that he gave to the vowel the true
       Latin sound as it appears in 'Mactavish'.</p>

    <p>A once well-known schoolmaster, a correspondent of
    Conington's, had a daughter born to him whom in his
    unregenerate days he christened Rosa. At a later time he became
    a purist in quantities, and then he shortened the <i>o</i> and
    took the voice out of the <i>s</i> and spoke of her and to her
    as Rossa. The mother and the sisters refused to acknowledge
    what they regarded as a touch of shamrock and clung
    persistently to the English flower. The good gentleman did not
    call his son Sol&#333;mon,<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       though this is the form which ought to be used by those who
       turn the traditional English 'Elk&#259;nah' into
       'Elk&#257;nah', 'Ab&#259;na' into 'Ab&#257;na', and
       'Zeb&#365;lun' into 'Zeb&#363;lun'. If they do not know</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Poor Elk&#259;nah, all other troubles past,</p>

            <p>For bread in Smithfield dragons hiss'd at last,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>yet at least they ought to know</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Of Abb&#259;na and Pharphar, lucid streams.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The malison of Milton on their heads! If the translators of
    the Bible had foreseen 'Zeb&#363;lun', they would have chosen
    some other word than 'princes' to avoid the cacophony of 'the
    princes of Zeb&#363;lun'.</p>

    <p>That these usages were familiar is evident from the
    pronunciation of proper, especially Biblical, names. Thus
    'B&#257;bel' and 'B&#259;bylon', 'N&#299;nus' and
    'N&#301;neveh', were spoken as unconsciously as M&#299;chael'
    and 'M&#301;chaelmas'. Nobody thought of asking the quantity of
    the Hebrew vowels before he spoke of 'C&#257;leb' and
    'B&#257;rak', of 'G&#301;deon' and 'G&#301;lead', of
    'D&#277;borah' and 'Ab&#301;melech', of '&#274;phraim' and
    'B&#275;lial'. The seeming exceptions can be explained. Thus
    the priest said 'H&#277;rod' because in the Vulgate he read
    'H&#277;rodes', but there was no Greek or Latin form to make
    him say anything else than 'M&#275;roz', 'P&#275;rez',
    'S&#275;rah', 'T&#275;resh'. He said '&#258;dam' because,
    although the Septuagint and other books retained the bare form
    of the name, there were <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span> other writings in which the
       name was extended by a Latin termination. There was no like
       extension to tempt him to say anything but 'C&#257;desh',
       '&#274;dom', 'J&#257;don', 'N&#257;dab'. I must admit my
       inability to explain 'Th&#335;mas', but doubtless there is a
       reason. The abbreviated form was of course first 'Th&#335;m'
       and then 'T&#335;m'. Possibly the pet name has claimed
       dominion over the classical form. As in the <i>herba
       impia</i> of the early botanists, these young shoots
       sometimes refuse to be 'trash'd for overtopping'.</p>

    <p>A story is told of an eccentric Essex rector. He was reading
    in church the fourth chapter of Judges, and after 'Now
    D&#277;borah, a prophetess', suddenly stopped, not much to the
    astonishment of the rustics, for they knew his ways. Then he
    went on 'Deb&#335;rah? Deb&#335;rah? Deb&#333;rah! Now
    Deb&#333;rah, a prophetess', and so on. Probably a freak of
    memory had reminded him that the letter was omega in the
    Septuagint. It will be remembered that Miss Jenkyns in
    <i>Cranford</i> liked her sister to call her Deb&#333;rah, 'her
    father having once said that the Hebrew name ought to be so
    pronounced', and it will not be forgotten that the good rector
    was too sound a scholar to read 'Deb&#333;rah' at the
    lettern.</p>

    <p>An anecdote of Burgon's is to the point. He had preached in
    St. Mary's what he regarded as an epoch-making sermon, and
    afterwards he walked home to Oriel with Hawkins, the famous
    Provost. He looked for comment and hoped for praise, but the
    Provost's only remark was, 'Why do you say Emm&#257;us?' 'I
    don't know; isn't it Emm&#257;us?' 'No, no; Emm&#259;us,
    Emm&#259;us.' When Hawkins was young, in the days of George
    III, every one said Emmaus, and in such matters he would say,
    'I will have no innovations in my time.' On the King's lips the
    phrase, as referring to politics, was foolish, but Hawkins used
    it with sense.</p>

    <p>PS.&mdash;I had meant to cite an anecdote of Johnson. As he
    walked in the Strand, a man with a napkin in his hand and no
    hat stept out of a tavern and said, 'Pray, Sir, is it
    irréparable or irrepáirable that one should say?'&mdash;'The
    last, I think, Sir, for the adjective ought to follow the verb;
    but you had better consult my dictionary than me, for that was
    the result of more thought than you will now give me time for.'
    The dictionary rightly gives <i>irréparable</i>, and both the

    <h3>ADDENDA TO HOMOPHONES IN TRACT II</h3>

    <p>Several correspondents complain of the incompleteness of the
    list of Homophones in Tract II. The object of that list was to
    convince readers of the magnitude of the mischief, and the
    consequent necessity for preserving niceties of pronunciation:
    evidence of its incompleteness must strengthen its plea. The
    following words may be added; they are set here in the order of
    the literary alphabet.</p>

    <h3>THE SKILFUL LEECH</h3>

    <p>The Poet Laureate has pointed out that several useful words
    have been lost to the English language because their identity
    in sound with other words renders it impossible to use them
    without the risk either of being misunderstood or of calling up
    undesirable associations. It is owing to this cause that
    English&mdash;or, at least, the English of Great
    Britain&mdash;has no word that can correctly be used as a
    general designation for a member of the healing profession. In
    America, I believe, the word is 'physician'; but in England
    that appellation belongs to one branch of the profession
    exclusively. The most usual term here is 'doctor'; but the M.D.
    rightly objects to the application of this title to his
    professional brother who has no degree; and in a university
    town to say that John Smith is a doctor would be inconveniently
    ambiguous. 'Medical man' is cumbrous, and has the further
    disadvantage (in these days) of not being of common gender. Now
    the lack of any proper word for a meaning so constantly needing
    to be expressed is certainly a serious defect in modern
    (insular) English. The Americans have some right to crow over
    us here; but their 'physician' is a long word; and though it
    has been good English in the sense of <i>medicus</i> for six
    hundred years, it ought by etymology to mean what
    <i>physicien</i> does in French, and <i>physicist</i> in modern
    English. Our ancestors were better off in this respect than
    either we or the Americans. The only native
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span> word to denote a practiser of
       the healing art is <i>leech</i>, which is better than the
       foreign 'physician' because it is shorter. It was once a
       term of high dignity: Chaucer could apply it figuratively to
       God, as the healer of souls; and even in the sixteenth
       century a poet could address his lady as 'My sorowes leech'.
       Why can we not so use it now? Why do we not speak of 'The
       Royal College of Leeches'? Obviously, because a word of the
       same form happens to be the name of an ugly little animal of
       disgusting habits. If I were to introduce my medical
       attendant to a friend with the words 'This is my leech', the
       gentleman (or lady) so presented would think I was indulging
       in the same sort of pleasantry as is used when a coachman is
       called a 'whip'; and he (or she) would probably not consider
       the joke to be in the best of taste. Of course all educated
       people know that it was once not unusual to speak of a man
       of medicine as a 'leech'; but probably there are many who
       imagine that this designation was a disparaging allusion to
       the man's tool of trade, and that it could be applied only
       to inferior members of the profession. The ancient
       appellation of the healer is so far obsolete that if I were
       to answer a question as to a man's profession with the words
       'Oh, he is a leech', there would be some risk of being
       misunderstood to mean that he was a money-lender.</p>

    <p>Etymologists generally have regarded the name of the
    bloodsucking animal as the same word with <i>leech</i> a
    physician, the assumption being that the animal received its
    name from its use as a remedial agent. But the early forms,
    both in English and Low German, show that the words are
    originally unconnected. The English for <i>medicus</i> was in
    the tenth century <i>læ&#769;ce</i> or <i>léce</i>, and in the
    thirteenth century <i>leche</i>; the word for <i>sanguisuga</i>
    was in the tenth century <i>lyce</i>, and in the thirteenth
    century <i>liche</i>. According to phonetic law the latter word
    should have become <i>litch</i> in modern English; but it very
    early underwent a punning alteration which made it homophonous
    with the ancient word for physician. The unfortunate
    consequence is that the English language has hopelessly lost a
    valuable word, for which it has never been able to find a
    satisfactory substitute.</p>

    <h3>DIFFERENTIATION OF HOMOPHONES</h3>

    <p>On this very difficult question the attitude of a careful
    English speaker is shown in the following extract from a letter
    addressed to us:</p>

    <h4>METAL, METTLE: and PRINCIPAL, PRINCIPLE</h4>

    <p>'I find that I do not <i>naturally</i> distinguish
    <i>metal</i> and <i>mettle</i> in pronunciation, tho' when
    there is any danger of ambiguity I say <i>metal</i> for the
    former and <i>met'l</i> for the latter; and I should probably
    do so (without thinking about it) in a public speech. In my
    young days the people about me usually pronounced <i>met'l</i>
    for both. Theoretically I think the distinction is a desirable
    one to make; the fact that the words are etymologically
    identical seems to me irrelevant. The words are distinctly two
    in modern use: when we talk of <i>mettle</i> (meaning
    spiritedness) there is in our mind no thought whatever of the
    etymological sense of the word, and the recollection of it, if
    it occurred, would only be disturbing. So I intend in future to
    pronounce metal as <i>met&#601;l</i> (when I don't forget). And
    I am not sure that <i>met&#601;l</i> is, strictly speaking, a
    "spelling-pronunciation": It is possible that the difference in
    spelling originated in a difference of pronunciation, not the
    other way about. For <i>metal</i> in its literal sense was
    originally a scientific word, and in that sense may have been
    pronounced carefully by people who would pronounce it
    carelessly when they used it in a colloquial transferred sense
    approaching to slang.</p>

    <p>'The question of <i>principal</i> and <i>principle</i> is
    different. When I was young, educated people in my circle
    always, I believe, distinguished them; so to this day when I
    hear principal pronounced as principle it gives me a squirm,
    tho' I am afraid nearly everybody does it now. That the words
    are etymologically distinct does not greatly matter; it is of
    more importance that I have sometimes been puzzled to know
    which word a speaker meant; if I remember right, I once had to
    ask.</p>

    <p>'It would be worth while to distinguish <i>flower</i> and
    <i>flour</i> (which originally, like <i>metal</i> and
    <i>mettle</i>, were the same word); yet in practice it is not
    easy to make the difference audible. The homophony is sometimes
    inconvenient.'</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>

    <h4>CORRECTION TO TRACT II</h4>

    <p>On p. 37 of TRACT II the words 'the Anglo-prussian society
    which Mr. Jones represents' have given offence and appear to be
    inaccurate. The German title of the series in which Jones's
    Dictionary is one has the following arrangement of words facing
    the English title:</p>

    <center>
        HERAUSGEGEBEN
    </center>

    <center>
        UND
    </center>

    <center>
        DER <b>"ASSOCIATION PHONÉTIQUE INTERNATIONALE"</b> GEWIDMET
    </center>

    <center>
        VON
    </center>

    <center>
        <b>H. MICHAELIS,</b>
    </center>

    <p>and this misled me. I am assured that, though the dictionary
    may be rightly described as Anglo-Prussian, the Phonetic
    Association is Gallo-Scandinavian. In behalf of the S.P.E. I
    apologize to the A. Ph. I. for my mistake which has led one of
    its eminent associates to accuse me of bearing illwill towards
    the Germans. The logic of that reproach baffles me utterly.</p>

    <p class="author">[R.B.]</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>SOME LEXICAL MATTERS</h3>

    <h4>FAST = QUICK or FIRM</h4>

    <p>'An Old Cricketer' writes:</p>

    <p>'After reading your remarks on the ambiguity of the word
    <i>fast</i> (Tract III, p. 12) I read in the report of a
    Lancashire cricket match that <i>Makepeace was the only batsman
    who was fast-footed</i>. But for the context and my knowledge
    of the game I should have concluded that Makepeace kept his
    feet immovably on the crease; but the very opposite was
    intended. At school we used to translate
    &pi;&omicron;&delta;&alpha;&sigmaf;
    &omega;&kappa;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
    &Alpha;&chi;&iota;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&sigmaf;
    "swift-footed Achilles", and I took that to mean that Achilles
    was a sprinter. I suppose <i>quick-footed</i> would be the
    epithet for Makepeace.'</p>

    <p>SPRINTER is a good word, though <i>Sprinting Achilles</i>
    could not be
    recommended.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>

    <h4>BRATTLE</h4>

    <p>A correspondent from Newcastle writes advocating the
    recognition of the word <i>brattle</i> as descriptive of
    thunder. It is a good old echo-word used by Dunbar and Douglas
    and Burns and by modern English writers. It is familiar through
    the first stanza of Burns's poem 'To a Mouse'.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Wee sleekit cow'rin tim'rous beastie,</p>

            <p>O what a panic's in thy breastie.</p>

            <p>Thou need na start awa sae hasty</p>

            <p class="i4">Wi' bickering brattle....</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>which is not suggestive of thunder. The <i>N.E.D.</i>
    explains this as 'to run with brattling feet, to scamper'.</p>

    <p>In Burns's 'A Winter Night', it is the noisy confusion of
    <i>biting Boreas</i> in the bare trees and bushes:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>I thought me on the ourie cattle</p>

            <p>Or silly sheep, wha bide this brattle</p>

            <p class="i6">O' winter war.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>It is possible that <i>brattle</i> has fallen into disuse
    through too indiscriminate application. After Burns's famous
    poem the word can establish itself only in the sense of a
    scurrying dry noise: it is too small for thunder.</p>

    <p>We would call attention to the principle involved in this
    judgement, for it is one of the main objects of our society to
    assist and guide Englishmen in the use of their language by
    fully exposing the facts that should determine their practice.
    Every word has its history, and no word can prosper in the
    speech or writing of those who do not respect its inherited and
    unalterable associations; these cannot be got rid of by
    ignoring them. Littré in the preface to his dictionary claims
    for it this pre-eminent quality of usefulness, that it will
    enable his countrymen to speak and write good French by
    acquainting them with historic tradition, and he says that it
    was enthusiasm for this one purpose that sustained him in his
    great work. Its object was to harmonize the present use of the
    language with the past usage, in order that the present usage
    may possess all the fullness, richness, and certitude which it
    can have, and which naturally belong to it. His words are:
    'Avant tout, et pour ramener à une idée mère ce qui va être
    expliqué dans la <i>Préface</i>, je dirai, définissant ce
    dictionnaire, qu'il embrasse et combine l'usage présent de la
    langue et son usage passé, afin de donner à l'usage présent
    toute la plénitude et la sûreté qu'il
    comporte.'</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>

    <p>It is the intention of our society to offer only expert and
    well-considered opinion on these literary matters, which are
    often popularly handled in the newspapers and journals as fit
    subjects for private taste and uninformed prejudice: and since
    the Oxford Dictionary has done more fully for English what
    Littré did for French, our task is comparatively easy. But
    experts cannot be expected, all of them, to have the
    self-denying zeal of Émile Littré, and the worth of our tracts
    will probably improve with the increase of our subscribers.</p>

    <h4>BICKER</h4>

    <p>As Burns happens to use <i>bickering</i> as his epithet for
    the mouse's brattle, we may take this word as another
    illustration of Littré's principle. The <i>N.E.D.</i> gives the
    original meaning as <i>skirmish</i>, and quotes
    Shakespeare,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>If I longer stay</p>

            <p>We shall begin our ancient bickerings,</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>which a man transposing the third and fourth words might say
    to-day without rising above colloquial speech; but there is
    another allied signification which Milton has in</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Smoak and bickering flame;</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>and this is followed by many later writers. It would seem
    therefore, if the word is to have a special sense, that it must
    be focused in the idea of something that both wavers and
    skirmishes, and this suggests another word which caught our eye
    in the dictionary, that is</p>

    <h4>BRANGLE</h4>

    <p>It is defined in the <i>N.E.D.</i> as 'a brawl, wrangle,
    squabble' and marked <i>obsolete</i>. It seems to differ from
    its numerous synonyms by the suggestion of what we call a
    muddle: that is an active wrangling which has become
    inextricably confused.</p>

    <h4>SURVIVALS IN LANCASHIRE SPEECH</h4>

    <p>Mr. Ernest Stenhouse sends us notes on Tract II, from which
    we extract the following:</p>

    <p>'<i>Poll</i> (= to cut the hair) is still familiar in
    Lancashire. <i>Tickle</i> (unstable) is obsolescent but not yet
    obsolete. As a child I often heard <i>meterly</i> (=
    moderately): e.g. <i>meterly fausse</i> (? false) = moderately
    cunning. It may still be in use. <i>Bout</i> (= without = A.S.
    butan) is commonly
    heard.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>

    <p>'The words tabulated in Tract II, p. 34, and the following
    pairs are not homophones in Lancashire: stork, stalk; pattern,
    patten; because although the <i>r</i> in stork and pattern is
    not trilled as in Scotland, it is distinctly indicated by a
    modification of the preceding vowel, somewhat similar to that
    heard in the <i>o&#865;re</i> words (p. 35).</p>

    <p>'Homophony may arise from a failure to make distinctions
    that are recognized in P.S.P. Thus in Lancashire the diphthong
    sound in <i>flow</i>, <i>snow</i>, <i>bone</i>, <i>coal</i>,
    <i>those</i>, &amp;c., is very often pronounced as a pure vowel
    (cf. French <i>eau</i>, <i>mot</i>): hence confusion arises
    between <i>flow</i> and <i>flaw</i>, <i>sow</i> and <i>saw</i>,
    <i>coal</i> and <i>call</i>: both these vowel sounds tending to
    become indistinguishable from the French <i>eau</i>.'</p>

    <h4>FEASIBLE</h4>

    <p><i>Feasible</i> is a good example of a word which appears in
    danger of being lost through incorrect and ignorant use. It can
    very well happen that a word which is not quite comfortable may
    feel its way to a useful place in defiance of etymology; and in
    such cases it is pedantry to object to its instinctive
    vagaries. But <i>feasible</i> is a well-set comfortable word
    which is being ignorantly deprived of its useful definite
    signification. In the following note Mr. Fowler puts its case
    clearly, and his quotations, being typically illustrative of
    the manner in which this sort of mischief comes about, are
    worthy of attention.</p>

    <p>'With those who feel that the use of an ordinary word for an
    ordinary notion does not do justice to their vocabulary or
    sufficiently exhibit their cultivation, who in fact prefer the
    stylish to the working word, <i>feasible</i> is now a prime
    favourite. Its proper sense is "capable of being done,
    accomplished, or carried out". That is, it means the same as
    <i>possible</i> in one of the latter's senses, and its true
    function is to be used instead of <i>possible</i> where that
    might be ambiguous. <i>A thunderstorm is possible</i> (but not
    <i>feasible</i>). Irrigation is possible (or, indifferently,
    <i>feasible</i>). <i>A counter-revolution is possible</i>;
    i.e., (<i>a</i>) one may for all we know happen, or (<i>b</i>)
    we can if we choose bring one about; but, if <i>b</i> is the
    meaning, <i>feasible</i> is better than <i>possible</i> because
    it cannot properly bear sense <i>a</i>, and therefore obviates
    ambiguity.</p>

    <p>'The wrong use of <i>feasible</i> is that in which, by a
    slipshod extension, it is allowed to have also the other sense
    of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> <i>possible</i>, and that of
       <i>probable</i>. This is described by the highest authority
       as "hardly a justifiable sense etymologically, and ...
       recognized by no dictionary". It is however becoming very
       common; in all the following quotations, it will be seen
       that the natural word would be either <i>possible</i> or
       <i>probable</i>, one of which should have been
       chosen:&mdash;Continuing, Mr. Wood said: "I think it is very
       feasible that the strike may be brought to an end this week,
       and it is a significant coincidence that ...". / Witness
       said it was quite feasible that if he had had night
       binoculars he would have seen the iceberg earlier. / We
       ourselves believe that this is the most feasible explanation
       of the tradition. / This would appear to offer a feasible
       explanation of the scaffold puzzle.'</p>

    <h4>PROTAGONIST</h4>

    <p>Mr. Sargeaunt (on p. 26) suggests that we might do well to
    keep the full Greek form of this word, and speak and write
    <i>protagonistes</i>. Familiarity with <i>Agonistes</i> in the
    title of Milton's drama, where it is correctly used as
    equivalent to 'mighty champion', would be misleading, and the
    rejection of the English form 'protagonist' seems otherwise
    undesirable. The following remarks by Mr. Fowler show that
    popular diction is destroying the word; and if ignorance be
    allowed its way we shall have a good word destroyed.</p>

    <p>'The word that has so suddenly become a prime favourite with
    journalists, who more often than not make it mean champion or
    advocate or defender, has no right whatever to any of those
    meanings, and almost certainly owes them to the mistaking of
    the first syllable (representing Greek
    &pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf; "first") for
    &pi;&rho;&omicron; "on behalf of"&mdash;a mistake made easy by
    the accidental resemblance to <i>antagonist</i>. "Accidental",
    since the Greek
    &alpha;&gamma;&omega;&nu;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf; has
    different meanings in the two words, in one "combatant", but in
    the other "play-actor". The Greek
    &pi;&rho;&omega;&tau;&alpha;&gamma;&omega;&nu;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;
    means the actor who takes the chief part in a play&mdash;a
    sense readily admitting of figurative application to the most
    conspicuous personage in any affair. The deuteragonist and
    tritagonist take parts of second and third importance, and to
    talk of several protagonists, or of a chief protagonist or the
    like, is an absurdity. In the newspapers it is a rarity to meet
    <i>protagonist</i> in a legitimate sense; but two examples of
    it are put first in the following collection. All the others
    are outrages on this learned-sounding word, because some of
    them distinguish between <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span> chief protagonists and others
       who are not chief, some state or imply that there are more
       protagonists than one in an affair, and the rest use
       <i>protagonist</i> as a mere synonym for advocate.</p>

    <p>'Legitimate uses: <i>The "cher Halévy" who is the
    protagonist of the amazing dialogue. / Marco Landi, the
    protagonist and narrator of a story which is skilfully
    contrived and excellently told, is a fairly familiar type of
    soldier of fortune.</i></p>

    <p>'Absurd uses with <i>chief</i>, &amp;c.: <i>The chief
    protagonist is a young Nonconformist minister. / Unlike a
    number of the leading protagonists in the Home Rule fight, Sir
    Edward Carson was not in Parliament when.... / It presents a
    spiritual conflict, centred about its two chief protagonists,
    but shared in by all its characters.</i></p>

    <p>'Absurd plural uses: <i>One of the protagonists of that
    glorious fight for Parliamentary Reform in 1866 is still
    actively among us. / One of these immense protagonists must
    fall, and, as we have already foreshadowed, it is the Duke. /
    By a tragic but rapid process of elimination most of the
    protagonists have now been removed. / As on a stage where all
    the protagonists of a drama assemble at the end of the last
    act. / That letter is essential to a true understanding of the
    relations of the three great protagonists at this period. / The
    protagonists in the drama, which has the motion and structure
    of a Greek tragedy</i> (Fy! fy!&mdash;a Greek tragedy and
    protagonists?).</p>

    <p>'Confusions with <i>advocate</i>, &amp;c.: <i>The new Warden
    is a strenuous protagonist of that party in Convocation. / Mr
    &mdash;&mdash;, an enthusiastic protagonist of militant
    Protestantism. / The chief protagonist on the company's side in
    the latest railway strike, Mr &mdash;&mdash;. / It was a happy
    thought that placed in the hands of the son of one of the great
    protagonists of Evolution the materials for the biography of
    another. / But most of the protagonists of this demand have
    shifted their ground. / As for what the medium himself or his
    protagonists may think of them&mdash;for etymological purposes
    that is neither here nor there.</i></p>

    <p>'Perhaps we need not consider the Greek scholar's feelings;
    he has many advantages over the rest of us, and cannot expect
    that in addition he shall be allowed to forbid us a word that
    we find useful. Is it useful? or is it merely a pretentious
    blundering substitute for words that are useful? <i>Pro-</i> in
    <i>protagonist</i> is not the opposite of <i>anti-</i>;
    <i>-agonist</i> is not the same as in <i>antagonist</i>;
    <i>advocate</i> and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"
       id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span> <i>champion</i> and
       <i>defender</i> and <i>combatant</i> are better words for
       the wrong senses given to <i>protagonist</i>; and
       <i>protagonist</i> in its right sense of <i>the</i> (not
       <i>a</i>) chief actor in an affair has still work to do if
       it could only be allowed to mind its own business.'</p>

    <h3>AMERICAN APPRECIATION</h3>

    <p>We are glad to reprint the following short extracts from the
    <i>New York Times Book Review and Magazine</i>, September 26,
    1920.</p>

    <h4>'THE CAMPAIGN FOR PURE ENGLISH</h4>

    <blockquote>
        <p>'Among those who joined it (the S.P.E.) immediately were
        Arthur J. Balfour, A.C. Bradley, Austin Dobson, Thomas
        Hardy, J.W. Mackail, Gilbert Murray, Mrs. Humphry Ward, and
        Mrs. Wharton.... The rallying of these men and women of
        letters was not more significant than the prompt adhesion
        of the Professors of English in the various British
        Universities: W.M. Dixon, Oliver Elton, E.S. Gordon, C.H.
        Herford, W.P. Ker, G.C. Moore-Smith, F.W. Moorman, A.
        Quiller-Couch, George Saintsbury, and H.C.K. Wyld....</p>

        <p>'There is a peril to the proper development of the
        language in offensive affectations, in persistent pedantry,
        and in other results of that comprehensive ignorance of the
        history of English, which we find plentifully revealed in
        many of our grammars. It is high time that men who love the
        language, who can use it deftly and forcibly, and who are
        acquainted with the principles and the processes of its
        growth, should raise the standard of independence....</p>

        <p>'It is encouraging to realize that the atrophy of the
        word-making habit is less obvious in the United States than
        it is in Great Britain.... We cannot but regret that it is
        not now possible to credit to their several inventors
        American compounds of a delightful
        expressiveness&mdash;<i>windjammer, loan-shark,
        scare-head</i>, and that more delectable
        <i>pussy-footed</i>&mdash;all of them verbal creations with
        an imaginative quality almost Elizabethan in its felicity,
        and all of them examples of the purest English.... We
        Americans made the compound <i>farm-hand</i>, and employ it
        in preference to the British [English?] <i>agricultural
        labourer</i>.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
           id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>

        <p>'<i>The attention of the officers of the society may be
        called to the late Professor Lounsbury's lively and
        enlightening</i> History of the English Language, <i>and to
        Professor George Philip Krapp's illuminating study of</i>
        Modern English.</p>

    <h4>REPORT</h4>

    <center>
        Of the proceedings of the Society for the first year ending
        Xmas, 1920.
    </center>

    <p>The Society still remains governed by the small committee of
    its original founders: the support of the public and the press
    has been altogether satisfactory: the suggestions and programme
    which the committee originally put forward have met with
    nothing but favourable criticism; no opposition has been
    aroused, and we are therefore encouraged to meet the numerous
    invitations that we have received from all parts of the
    English-speaking world to make our activities more widely
    known. The sale of the Tracts has been sufficient to pay their
    expenses; and we are in this respect very much indebted to the
    Oxford University Press for its generous co-operation; for it
    has enabled us to offer our subscribers good workmanship at a
    reasonable price. The publication of this Tract IV closes our
    first 'year': we regret that the prevalent national
    disturbances have extended it beyond the solar period, but the
    conditions render explanation and apology needless.</p>

    <p>Our list shows 188 members, and their names include many
    well-known men of letters, Professors of Literature, Editors,
    Journalists, and others interested in the history and present
    condition of the language. Nineteen members sent donations
    (above 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>) which together amounted to about
    £40; and thirty-two sent subscriptions of ten shillings for the
    supply of one year's publications.</p>

    <p>To these subscribers (whose names are printed in the list
    below) all the four Tracts for this year have been sent: and it
    will appear that since they might have bought the four Tracts
    for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, they have made a donation of
    2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> apiece to the funds of the Society. This
    margin is very useful and we hope that they will renew their
    10<i>s.</i> subscription in advance for the ensuing year. That
    will ensure their receiving the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span> Society's papers as they are
       issued, and it will much assist the machinery of
       publication. Also Members who have not hitherto subscribed
       are now specially invited to do so. They can judge of the
       Society's work, and can best support it in this way. The
       publications of 1921 <i>will be sent as soon as issued to
       all such subscribers</i>.</p>

    <p>Subscriptions may be sent to the Secretary, L. Pearsall
    Smith, 11 St. Leonard's Terrace, Chelsea, London, S.W., to whom
    all communications should be addressed, or they may be paid
    direct to 'Treasurer of S.P.E.', Barclay's Bank, High Street,
    Oxford.</p>

        <p>I regard this statement as inaccurate. The <i>-ous</i>
        in these words does not come from the nominative ending
        <i>-us</i>, but is the ordinary <i>-ous</i> from L.
        <i>-osus</i> (through Fr.). It was added to many Latin
        adjective stems, because the need of a distinctly
        adjectival ending was felt. Similarly in early French
        <i>-eux</i> was appended to adjectives when they were felt
        to require a termination, as in <i>pieux</i> from
        <i>pi-us</i>. Compare the English <i>capacious</i>,
        <i>veracious</i>, <i>hilarious</i>, where <i>-ous</i> is
        added to other stems than those in <i>o</i>. Other suffixes
        of Latin origin are used in the same way: e.g. <i>-al</i>
        in <i>aerial</i>, <i>ethereal</i>.&mdash;H.B.</p>

        <p>But pedantry would not suggest this. The New Testament
        has &Sigma;&omicron;&lambda;&omicron;&mu;&omega;&nu;, and
        the Latin Christian poets have the <i>o</i> short. True,
        the Vatican Septuagint has
        &Sigma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&mu;&omega;&nu;, but there
        the vowel of the first syllable is <i>a</i>.&mdash;H.B.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
